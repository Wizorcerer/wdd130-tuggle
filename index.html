                <p>Introduction: Light painting is a photography technique where a photographer uses a long exposure time in a dark environment, so that the camera picks up light sources as they move across the frame, and takes it as one stream.These could range from the mildly interesting, to the absurd. Please feel free to post some of your light paints here and share them with the world.</p>
